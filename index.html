    <h1>Video game editors</h1>
    <h2>A couple of my favorite applications available online for editing classic games </h2>
    <p>These tools don't require coding, unless you want to expand their functionality. They are great for getting practice in level design.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>S.M.I.L.E. (super metroid integrated level editor)</b></p>
    <p>This utility allows users to edit a ROM of Super Metroid. It has some limitations, it's 
        not exactly like creating a game using an engine. However, There's enough other 
        utilities out there that can allow users that capability. You can think of SMILE as a more sophisticated "Mario Maker". It allows you to rearrange tiles,
        copy and past tile sprites, edit item locations, etc.</p>

        <p><b>Weland (FORGE)</b></p>
        <p>If making DOOM-like games interests you, than consider using the Weland application. Creating playable environments is simple,
            essentially you connect dots to form polygons to make a birds eye view of a your map. Polygons can be rooms, platforms, fields, etc. Welands precursor,
            FORGE, was used to make early Bungie
            games, Marathon, Marathon II, and Marathon Infinity. </p>
